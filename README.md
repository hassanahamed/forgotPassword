# forgotPassword
in todays senario we usually see the case where we often forgot the password this is an solution of how the forgotpassword is build


in this case i have done it as follows:
i used a similar strategy of mean stack development where :

the user intilayy signs up using email address a valid one

this is stored in the mongodb

then while loggin in if he forgets the password

we can redirect him to a link and update the password



i have done the whole thing from the link below:

since after this some features have been upgraded and to make the model work after the upgradation i have done this.
